This is my set of applications to create, modify and similarly duplicate
existing entries into slightly modified entries.

There are 4 applications.
Two are to insert, view, update, show column information and delete
duplicate entries in the products table (which means parts to be
purchased, not sold)

The other two are for duplicating existing entries to something closely
similar and also for seeing the "big picture" of a complete materials
or labor assembly from bottom to top with all table entries.
